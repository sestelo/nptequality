# npregtest: Nonparametric Regression Tests for the Equality of k Functions

[![DOI]()]() [![CRAN status]()]() [![CRAN RStudio mirror downloads]()]()

`npregtest` is an R package that provides a method to test the
hypothesis of equality of the k regression functions. The test is based
on the comparison of two estimators of the distribution of the errors in
each population. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cram√©r-von Mises type statistics
are considered. A bootstrap procedure is used to approximates the
critical values of the test.
