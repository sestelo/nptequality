# nptequality: Nonparametric Tests for the Equality of k Regression Functions

`nptequality` is an R package that provides a method to test the hypothesis of equality of the k regression functions. The test is based on the comparison of two estimators of the distribution of the errors in each population. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cram√©r-von Mises type statistics are considered. A bootstrap procedure is used to approximates the critical values of the test.
